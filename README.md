For the Gem script id recommend having noclip on. I will later combine these two scripts into one lame ahh GUI.

Main Script:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmsjayden/Roll/refs/heads/main/Jule.lua"))();

ðŸ’ŽGem Teleport ScriptðŸ’Ž:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmsjayden/Roll/refs/heads/main/TJule.lua"))();

Testing Script:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmsjayden/Roll/refs/heads/main/Crafting%20RNG%20teleport.lua"))();
